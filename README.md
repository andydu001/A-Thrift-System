Helloooo! This is a distributed system software.
The goal(s) of this project are to use Apache's Thrift application technology to develop a distributed system.
One of the main reasons I chose to do this project is to face the complexity of such an endeavor.
One of the main challenges is to deal with abstractions and interfaces. For example, I am using the communication protocol 
such as TProtocal.
